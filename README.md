  The IBM Watson&trade; Natural Language Classifier service applies deep learning techniques to make predictions about the best predefined classes for short sentences or phrases. The classes can trigger a corresponding action in an application, such as directing a request to a location or person, or answering a question. After training, the service returns information for texts that it hasn't seen before. The response includes the name of the top classes and confidence values.

Give it a try! Click the button below to fork into IBM DevOps Services and deploy your own copy of this application on Bluemix.

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/natural-language-classifier-nodejs)

## Getting started

1. You need a Bluemix account. If you don't have one, [sign up][sign_up]. Experimental Watson Services are free to use.

1. Download and install the [Cloud-foundry CLI][cloud_foundry] tool if you haven't already.

1. Edit the `manifest.yml` file and change `<application-name>` to something unique. The name you use determines the URL of your application. For example, `<application-name>.mybluemix.net`.

	```
	applications:
	- services:
	  - natural-language-classifier-service
	  name: <application-name>
	  command: node app.js
	  path: .
	  memory: 128M
	```

1. Connect to Bluemix with the command line tool.

	```sh
	$ cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net
	$ cf login -u <your user ID>
	```

1. Create the Natural Language Classifier service in Bluemix.

	```sh
	$ cf create-service natural_language_classifier standard natural-language-classifier-service
	```

1. Push your app to make it live:

	```sh
	$ cf push
	```

1. [Create and train](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/nl-classifier/get_start.shtml#create) the NLC service using the weather training data. Take note of the `<classifier-id>`.

1. To configure the [app.js](app.js#L48) file to use your classifier, export the classifier ID as an environment variable.

	```sh
	$ cf set-env <application-name> CLASSIFIER_ID <classifier-id>
	```

1. Finally, restage the application to ensure the environment variable is set.

	```sh
	$ cf restage <application-name>
	```

	For more details about developing applications that use Watson Developer Cloud services in Bluemix, see [Getting started with Watson Developer Cloud and Bluemix][getting_started].

## Running locally
1. Download and install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

1. Create an instance of the Natural Language Classifier service on Bluemix.

1. [Create and train](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/doc/nl-classifier/get_start.shtml#create) the NLC service using, for example, the weather training data. Note the value of the `Classifier ID` in the response.

1. Configure the code to connect to your service:

	1. Copy the credentials from your `natural-language-classifier-service` service in Bluemix. Run the following command:

		```sh
		$ cf env <application-name>
		```

		Example output:

		```sh
		System-Provided:
		{
		  "VCAP_SERVICES": {
			"natural_language_classifier": [
			  {
				"credentials": {
				  "password": "<password>",
				  "url": "<url>",
				  "username": "<username>"
				}
				"label": "natural-language-classifier",
				"name": "natural-language-classifier-service",
				"plan": "standard",
				"tags": [
				  ...
				]
			  }
			]
		  }
		}
		```

	1. Copy `username`, `password`, and `url` from the credentials.
	1. Open the `app.js` file and paste the username, password, and url credentials for the service.
	1. In the `app.js` file paste the "Classifier ID". Save the `app.js` file.


1. Install the Natural Language Classifier Node.js package:
	1. Change to the new directory that contains the project.
	2. Run the following command:node

	```node
	$ npm install
	```

1. Run the following command to start the application:

	```node
	node app.js
	```

1. Point your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

1. Train the classifier, if you haven't already. See the step earlier under Getting started.


## Troubleshooting

* The main source of troubleshooting and recovery information is the Bluemix log. To view the log, run the following command:

  ```sh
  $ cf logs <application-name> --recent
  ```

### Privacy Notice

This node sample web application includes code to track deployments to Bluemix and other Cloud Foundry platforms. The following information is sent to a [Deployment Tracker][deploy_track_url] service on each deployment:

* Application Name (`application_name`)
* Space ID (`space_id`)
* Application Version (`application_version`)
* Application URIs (`application_uris`)

This data is collected from the `VCAP_APPLICATION` environment variable in IBM Bluemix and other Cloud Foundry platforms. This data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Bluemix. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker service will be tracked.

### Disabling Deployment Tracking

Deployment tracking can be disabled by removing `require('cf-deployment-tracker-client').track();` from the beginning of the `server.js` file at the root of this repo.
